The program \ty{fur} finds unique regions in genome
sequences~\cite{hau21:fur}. It takes as input a set of target genomes
and a set of closely related, but distinct, neighbor genomes. Then
\ty{fur} finds the regions common to all targets that are absent form
the neighbors. Such regions can be used to construct genetic markers.

The version of \ty{fur} presented in the original publication yielded
PCR markers of excellent specificity and
sensitivity~\cite{hau21:fur}. However, the program was based on
indexing all neighbors in one fell swoop, which didn't scale for large
genomes, or for the large collections of bacterial genomes now
routinely collected during an outbreak.

In version 4 of \ty{fur} we replaced this monolithic indexing by
iterative indexing, which reduced the memory requirement from
proportional to the size of the complete neighborhood to the size of
the longest neighbor sequence. In addition, iterative indexing opened
the way to parallelization, which sped up \ty{fur} dramatically.

In this document we explore the application of the new \ty{fur} to
large collections of bacterial genomes. The choice of target genomes
is delegated to the NCBI, which keeps a ``small curated subset of
really good and scientifically important prokaryotic genomes'' on its
website at

\normalsize We downloaded this file on November 16, 2023, although its
time stamp is February 11, 2019. Table~\ref{tab:pro} shows an edited
version of the 109 bacteria singled out by the NCBI, ordered by the
number of sequenced genomes. The number of sequences ranges from
15,316 for \emph{Eschrerichia coli} to one for six taxa, including
\emph{Streptomyces coelicolor}, which, according to the NCBI, is
``responsible for producing more than half the known natural
antibiotics''.

Figure~\ref{fig:pro} shows the number of
sequenced genomes as a function of the taxon's table rank. Notice the
two phases in the graph, the first containing organisms with 2000
genomes or more, and the rest.

We have analyzed these strains to demonstrate the feasibility of
marker discovery in the large using Fur. For each strain we download
the target and neighbor genomes, extract the markers from them, and
pick the best pair of PCR primers from the markers. Finally we test
the primers to calculate their sensitivity and specificity. This gives
a rough indication of what to expect when applying the primers
\emph{in vitro}.
